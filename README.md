# CS3219 Assignment B

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kester-ng/Assignment-2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kester-ng/Assignment-2)

## Assignment B1

### Description

A simple RESTFUL API to update and keep track of ingredients or food items and how much it costs. Not really useful, but a simple demo for RESTFUL API with node.js, express and mongoDB. Used MongoDB Atlas to host online DB. 

### Dependencies

Please install these on your own!

1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

2. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)


### Setting up Locally

1. Git clone the repository. Then at root folder, type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

2. To start up the local mongodb, type in `npm run start_db` at root of the project.

3. To start up the server, type in `npm run dev` at root of the project.

4. Then to access, go to `localhost:8080`

5. To access the RESTFUL api for the server, go to `localhost:8080/api/ingredients`. If you omit `/ingredients`, you will see a webpage with a happy message :).

6. Go Postman and try out the requests!

### To access the API on an endpoint (Heroku)

1. Just type in this link -> `https://contact-heroku.herokuapp.com/api/ingredients`.

2. The routes are the same, `https://contact-heroku.herokuapp.com/api` will direct you to a webpage with a happy message :).
 
### Data structure for database

Each ingredient contains 3 fields, all which are required. What the fields represent are self-explanatory They are:

1. Name: `String`

2. Price: `Float`

3. Stock: `Int`

4. _id: `Int`, this is auto-generated by Mongo Sequence Auto-increment. Can be ignored, here for your reference. `_id` is unique.

### Sample of POST, GET, UPDATE/PUT, DELETE (Using postman)

#### Get

##### GET Request

#### PUT/UPDATE

Required to update all fields!.

##### PUT Request

#### DELETE REQUEST

##### DELETE Request

##### DELETE RESULT

## Assignment B2

### Testing locally

1. Tests all `PUT`, `DELETE`, `POST`, and `GET` requests.

2. To run locally, simply type in `npm run test`

3. Ensure the mongodb is running -> `npm run start_db`

### Testing via travis CI

1. The files already contain the travis configurations.

2. Simply fork the repo and then add it to your travis account.

3. Trigger a build and see the same few tests running but on travis. Subsequently, any merges or updates to your forked repo will automatically trigger a build!

## Assignment B3

### Endpoint for AWS Lambda function

Do take note. Currently, in postman, you can only POST/UPDATE with a body that is raw (ie x-www-form-urlencoded not supported). Do see picture below for an example.

![Example](images/lambda.png)

1. GET - https://pyyz2y0tzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingredients

2. GET - https://pyyz2y0tzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingredients/{id}

3. POST - https://pyyz2y0tzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingredients

4. DELETE - https://pyyz2y0tzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingredients/{id}

5. UPDATE - https://pyyz2y0tzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingredients/{id}

Also, travis will auto deploy the lambda functions onto AWS. However, if you would like to try to deploy it. It is important to configure a IAM user, and add in your own AWS access key and private key. And also change the process.env db link to your own db link. And any changes to the code will be deployed to AWS as well!
